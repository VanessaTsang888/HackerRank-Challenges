#Problem

Java's System.out.printf function can be used to print formatted output. The purpose of this exercise is to test your understanding of formatting output using printf.

To get you started, a portion of the solution is provided for you in the editor; you must format and print the input to complete the solution.

##Input Format

Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
Each String will have a maximum of  alphabetic characters, and each integer will be in the inclusive range from  to .

##Output Format

In each line of output there should be two columns:
The first column contains the String and is left justified using exactly  characters.
The second column contains the integer, expressed in exactly  digits; if the original input has less than three digits, you must pad your output's leading digits with zeroes.
